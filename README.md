# Resume-Screening-tool
An end-to-end AI Resume Screening Tool built with spaCy, scikit-learn, and Streamlit. It extracts skills, estimates experience, computes semantic similarity between job descriptions and resumes, and ranks candidates using an ML model or heuristic scoring — all with privacy-first, in-memory processing and explainable results.
